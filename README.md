If the current revenue or net income is close to or exceeds the historical maximum, this can indicate that the company is performing well. On the other hand, if the current revenue or net income is significantly lower than the historical maximum, this may indicate that the company is facing challenges or experiencing a downturn in performance.

They are particularly useful for identifying patterns or trends in data, such as strengths and weaknesses of different options or alternatives. this will help us to identify outliers, similarities or differences between groups, and to highlight areas that may require further investigation or attention.and I used combo box to filter by month on dashboard
